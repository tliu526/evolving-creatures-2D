# evolving-creatures-2D
The project is divided into directories <b>code/</b>, <b>journal/</b>, <b>lib/</b>, and <b>old/</b>.

The <b>code</b> directory contains all the source files for evolving creatures, implemented in javascript using box2D as a physics simulator. Open code/source/index.html to see the project.

The <b>journal</b> directory contains screenshots and a journal documenting our progress during the development of the project. Run doxygen in this directory and inspect journal.dox to see this progress.

The <b>lib</b> directory contains the support code for libraries used by the evolving creatures project.

The <b>old</b> directory is simply a place to keep code that we do not want to delete but are currently not using in our project.
